# RpiLEDcontrol
Tkinter app in python that controls led strip lights through GPIO

colortest and testcolor are useless i forget what they were for

schedule planner is unfinished i am too lazy, also working on a webserver based version
the main script was more of a test to make sure this would work at all

I made this like a year or two ago it's not efficient I know

I would update it with threading and use a format like mvc, but I no longer live at home so I have no use for this. Also could definitely should be rebuilt as a webserver
